# Lessons About Rejection and How They Landed Me a Program Manager Dream Job at Microsoft 
### by Isadora Maria Mendes de Souza (ismendes@microsoft.com)

Getting a scholarship and becoming a Grace Hopper Celebration Scholar involves several steps, and these steps often involve rejection.
I'm sure that many of you here are here today because you applied for and received a scholarship, as I did in 2018. I also understand that many of you did not get a scholarship and still sought alternatives to attend the event, either through other forms of sponsorship, or by paying out of your own pocket, considering that this event is a "must" in any woman's career in technology.

My name is Isadora Mendes, as known as Isa, and I am Business Program Manager at Microsoft. I came here to share with you the lessons I learned about rejection from my experience applying to become a GHC scholar in 2018 and thereafter. I will share with you my story and describe how feelings of rejection played a pivotal role in forming who I am today. I will share how in learning to digest this rejection I secured a job that I’ve always dreamed about.

Part of the selection process for getting a scholarship, as you may know, is getting a letter of recommendation from a professor at your current university. This task can be very easy for students engaged in scientific research, but it can become a challenge when you are not, and unlike students who can dedicate themselves exclusively to studies, you need to divide your life between working to live in a different city from your family and study, which ends up directly or indirectly affecting your academic performance.
That was my case.

In the first year of university, I managed to keep my academic performance very high, and that guaranteed me a full scholarship in California for a year and a half, everything paid: food, housing, tuition, monthly stipend.
My time in California was very good, and again, my high academic performance brought me my first internship at the United States Department of Defense. When I finished this first internship, I had been selected already to take another internship at the multinational NCR. Thereafter, returned home to Brazil.

When I arrived, I couldn't count on the financial support of my family to stay in another city, and so I needed to find work. Unfortunately, the country's economy was not favorable for technology interns in the small country town of São Paulo where I studied. My options were limited and thus I had regressed from super interesting internships in California, to work on weekends as a waitress and bartender, a job very exhaustive which I had no passion for. This combined with a super deep depression made my academic performance go down the drain. I started as a student with a near perfect GPA, but by this point I had become a student who’d just barely pass. I got by with the minimum or a little more than the minimum in most of my courses.

After asking for a letter of recommendation from four teachers and being rejected by all of them, I seriously thought about giving up.
The feeling of rejection and non-belonging dominated me, and I was reminded of the seemingly countless episodes during my childhood when the physical education teacher divided the class into teams, and I was always picked last. 
You know that feeling?

The teacher picks two captains, they start choosing their teammates, and they never call you, until you are the last option left, and you end up on a team that had no choice but to accept you.

Has anyone experienced this here, or is it just me?

The feeling of being the rejected gym student came back to me, and I felt that I shouldn't be there at that university, that my performance was poor because I was less capable than the others. I needed to work. Students who must work to pay for their studies in Brazil rarely go to universities like the University of Sao Paulo. USP is a public university, and so students who are accepted have their tuition covered by the government, but the entrance exams are incredibly difficult. That’s why most students there are the ones that had the best opportunities in life, including great schools, music classes, dance, and expensive preparatory courses. Not really my case though. I, on the other hand was just a student from a poor family who had “luckily” won a spot there, but it felt clear that I stood out and shouldn't be there.

From this episode of my story, I bring the first lesson:

Don’t feel sorry about yourself.
The place where you came from, your humble background, your difficulty in learning math. All your perceived inadequacies can never be factors that dictate where you are going, or what your limit is. You and your experiences are unique, the good and bad things that happened to you are the reasons for being exactly who you are! Embrace yourself. 
Another lesson followed thereafter, and I think many of you may have heard it before!

Rejection is never personal.
The fact that four teachers refused to write me a letter of recommendation didn't exactly mean that they didn't think I was a "good fit" to be a GHC scholar. After all, none of them had even heard about GHC before. Probably they just didn't remember enough about me to say something good, they were extremely busy, they didn't understand the value of their contribution when writing a letter of recommendation, and with that, I couldn't gain priority on their schedule.

After a few days of reflecting on these lessons, trying to find the so-called self-love, I decided that I was not going to give up, but I had to change my strategy.

If my academic performance in the first year, my scholarship to study at the University of California and international internships didn't speak enough about me in order to get a professor to write a letter of recommendation, I needed to change my strategy, and I needed to be quick!

That was how I decided to talk to a professor from my first year, from a class that I passed with a perfect grade of 10. I was totally transparent about my situation. But in addition, I improved my sales skills (haha).

I focused my pitch on my engagement with technology events. I stressed that in those last two years, in addition to working on the weekends as a waitress, I had managed an internship at a chatbot startup, where I used to do a little bit of everything: project management, customer facing, writing and reviewing code among other things. I mentioned that I use to always attended events in the city's startup community, sign up for events promoted by companies like Google and Facebook, and that my behavior concerning these events was “aggressive”, in the sense that I was always keen on being present and creating connections. I explained that myself, along with a HR contact at Google that had interviewed me were in talks about organizing an event for women in computing at my university. Finally, when I had nothing more to say about me, I said: Do you remember that I closed with a 10 in your class? I told him that my current grades were simply a result of my busy routine, but I am interested and passionate about technology. I said “what I'm asking you for here is an opportunity, writing me a letter of recommendation will do nothing to hurt your career as a PhD, but for me it will make all the difference. Would you please make a letter of recommendation to me by the end of this week?”

When I finished, he opened his eyes wide and said:

- I would make the letter of recommendation for you, but today is Thursday and getting it done by tomorrow is very difficult, is the deadline tomorrow?

I breathed a sigh of relief and said:

- No, but it's next Monday. Can you write it then?

He breathed a sigh of relief as well and said:

- Ah ok, if it's Monday coming up okay, I can work on it during that weekend.

This is where I share my next lesson:

My change in strategy is quite evident. Rather than try to cover up or sugarcoat the truth that I was struggling academically, I instead tried to name all the reasons why I felt I was worthy of a letter of recommendation for the GHC scholarship.
My total transparency and sincerity made it possible for that professor to empathize with me, and from an empathic point of view, he understood that my request was not a threat to his reputation as a PhD research professor at the University of São Paulo.
Often people will say no, not because they’re unwilling to help, but because they don't have enough information. If what you're asking for is unclear, then it can make them feel threatened. It is up to you to understand how to assess the situation with transparency so that they can empathize and trust you.

Another lesson here, which I would like to reinforce, was that when I finished my request, I made the timeline less rushed. I started with a more difficult request, “can you write this for me by tomorrow?” and simplified it to the next Monday. When you ask for something much more difficult, you will probably hear no, but in that moment, you create an opportunity to ask for something simpler, and the person who initially rejected you tends to be more receptive to saying yes the second time. Typically, when people reject a request, they tend to want to repair that relationship that was built based on trust and empathy. So, following up with a simpler request provides them a chance to do just that.

Finally, I had a professor who was willing to submit a letter of recommendation for me, and so I finished the application. What I decided to do that same day was hang a message on my wall, written on a pretty piece of paper, saying: “Isa Mendes is a GHC18 scholar”.
I looked and read that paper every day. I could make an entire presentation about the importance of projecting what you want to happen, but as it isn’t relevant to my message I digress.

A few months passed, and it was afternoon when I received the email. Honestly, that day was one of the most exciting days of my academic life. After so many ups and downs, with downs lower than the bottom of the blackest hole, I received an email inviting me to be a GHC scholar!

Receiving the scholarship to attend the event meant the world to me. I felt that the dream of working in a big company was closer and I felt very fulfilled because that dream has always been bigger than me. It was never about me and my big ego, but about Isadora who decided to study computer science because she always saw in technology a way to love others, to democratize education and the right to work, to reduce social differences, and make the world a better place.

Arriving at the event, I participated in several presentations like this one, and I went to the recruitment fair every day. I printed 100 resumes, made a beautiful business card, and on a shoestring I “sold” myself to companies. As my extremely sincere sales strategy guaranteed me the letter of recommendation, what I decided to do was exactly that, to be super sincere about myself, about my image full of tattoos and piercings, and about what I was looking for professionally. What I did was something like this. I went booths, and engaged in conversation:

- Hello! How are you? Nice to meet you, I'm Isadora, I'm Brazilian, I graduated at the end of this year at the University of São Paulo and I'm looking at internship opportunities here at the event, but I'm not exactly looking to be a software engineer, but areas that my technical knowledge is a plus, something more like project management, technical sales, or things like that ...

In some cases, I barely finished the sentence and they already told me:

- How cool Isadora, is the University of São Paulo here in the United States? We do not support the visa process; you would need to be a student here.

Then I answered:

- Oh no, São Paulo is in Brazil. Thanks! (LMAO) 

This happened a few times and then I decided not to mention my nationality anymore despite knowing that my accent gave me away. I remember that in one of the conversations I finally brought up the following sentence:

- I know how to code very well, but I don’t see myself in the image of a computer hacker, who loves to spend hours and hours in front of the computer.

And what I heard in response summarizes my experience with almost every company:

- Isadora, maybe our company has role for someone with your profile, I'm not sure, but here we are recruiting computer hacker girls.
The conversations were always wonderful, but in the end that was what I heard from almost all companies:

- Isadora, your resume is very good, but I think we have no vacancies for what you are looking for now”. Or things like:

- Are you sure you don't want to try applying for the vacant software engineering position. If you want, apply here and take the test tomorrow, because we are after engineers and the compensation is very very good!

After growing tired of hearing no and being rejected again and again, I applied to a large company that had a hiring process for software engineers since after all, that was what they were offering.

The result?

I could not complete every question despite having experience with the subject. But the main factor was not lack of preparation, I mean, everyone here should know that if you want to pass a technical interview you must have read “cracking the code interview” and have completed a lot of Leetcode questions, but the point is that I didn't want to be a software engineer.

On the second day of event I received an email from the company saying that I had not passed, and I cried in the hotel bed for almost two hours. I seriously thought about not getting up and lying in bed all day. However, this was not the deal with the organization of the event when I accepted the scholarship, I felt obliged to continue to talk to companies, watch as many presentations as possible, and try to create connections.

This whole process was very painful and after all, I once again felt like the rejected gym student Isadora, her voice was talking to me, saying: “Hey, I told you. You don’t belong here!”

Finally, on the last day of the event I decided to go to Microsoft's booth. I had already stopped trying my original sales pitch, because I already expected them to have no jobs that suit me.

I got there, and the shy Isadora started the conversation:

"Hi…"

And a woman said: 

- Hi, how are you? What do you think of the event?

I smiled and embarrassed to be totally honest, I said:

- Very inspiring ... But I'm not sure if I'm technical enough to be here!

The conversation continued, she asked about my degree, my experiences, and I told her. I showed my resume and while we talked I discretely commented that I was not feeling included, that my experience in the other recruiting booths had made it clear that they had no vacancies for people with my talent and that this was very disappointing and painful, because I thought that as a computer woman I would get at least a few interviews in my field. As she watched me and my resume, she commented:

- Isadora, all that you are telling me about your professional experience at the bot startup, plus your internships as a software engineer, your English is very good! I understand the fact that other companies have jobs only for software engineers and that not everyone offers visa support, but Microsoft has openings for Program Managers, Technical Sales, and many other things that involve not only the hard skills you have, but mainly the soft skills. I can help you better structure your resume if you want, but you should submit your resume the way it is TODAY anyway, to get a chance to be selected for mentoring with one of our Microsoft CVPs.

I had already been rejected so many times, and I had another 15m at the fair, so why not?

I submitted my resume, the event ended, I went back to Brazil and I thought: "that's it, show must go on!".

And the next lesson I want to share with you is:

We will often receive rejection from places that we could never imagined.

You must be resilient, as I said before, to be able to absorb the good part of the rejection, but above all, get rid of the part of the rejection that yells words of withdrawal in your ear.

As I mentioned before, I have depression, and as much as I was trying to seek to absorb only the good part and continue to establish connections with the people I met at the event, this feeling of "you were rejected because you are useless" really took over from me for a few weeks, until I decided to take a different stance.

To help me, I replaced the beautiful note that I pasted on my bedroom wall with a different phrase:

“Isa Mendes will work at Microsoft in 2019”.

I overcame myself.

I was feeling super sad, so I started asking myself: “Why do I want to work in a big company? Is all this a result of my ego? What do I really want?”

I understood why this voice inside of me that tells me that I will do great things was asking me for a job in a big company. The voice that says that if I want, one day I will become a CEO of a technology company is not my ego, it is really my passion for technology moving me, my driving force. It is this passion that becomes a need to work on something that impacts the lives of more people. My love for technology is just my love for human beings. I am passionate about technology, I see through it a fairer world, where everyone can have access to basic things. A world where people don't need to work with routines that suck 100% of their energy so that they can apply themselves to others more pleasurable and less stressful activities, a world that is not hungry, thirsty, sick, and where technology makes life less painful for human beings in some way.

When I was finally able to answer that for myself, I rejected the negative side of life, loss, and rejection itself. I left behind this habit that I had to see everything from the perspective of loss, after all, everything has its gain, I was just too blind to see.
I hadn’t missed anything by going to the event, and deciding not to stop being who I am, just to get a job. When everyone rejects you, what is left to you is only you sometimes, it is important that you know how to value yourself and embrace your causes, even if it costs you in the short term.

When I assimilated all this, on a sunny morning, I open my email and read this:

"You were selected for a mentorship with Gavriella Schuster, Microsoft's CVP. Do you accept?"

I accepted of course!

On the scheduled date and time, we started our session, and again, I was an open book about who I am and about my experience at the event. I tried to create a bridge based on empathy and trust as I did successfully before with the professor. Only this time, I added a very bold question.

I filled my chest with air and courage and said:

-	I'm afraid I made the wrong decision about my university major, and I would like some advice on that. I'm majoring in computer science this year and I really want to work on something that has an impact on the world with my technology, but I'm not a computer hacker. I was rejected by all companies during the GHC because, either they didn't support the visa, or they were just looking for software engineers. I have already applied to large companies like Microsoft several times, I have several skills and values that I see as a perfect match for Microsoft, but still, what I see are people with less curriculum than me, or less alignment with the company mission, from the same university as me, getting internships, jobs, while I'm not even called for a technical interview. I wonder why?
When I finally stopped talking, my whole body was shaking, and my breathing was short. I had been too bold, I was afraid. And she said:

- How about this, what do you think about being interviewed to take an internship here at Microsoft? I know a team of Program Managers who have exactly this hybrid profile that would suit you. If you become our intern, you will have the opportunity to find out if Microsoft is really a fit for you, while we evaluate whether you are a fit for us as well.

Obviously, I accepted the invitation, and was interviewed by the team.

And the lesson I would like to share at this point is that we should ask bold questions when we are rejected. I had already applied for Microsoft Brazil in 2017 and was rejected even before the technical interview. After the event I applied for several jobs on the career website as well, and I never received any feedback. Being a leader brings you many missions, and if you want to be an inclusive leader, you might need to know how to include yourself as well. Have the courage to ask why you are not being included or why you are being rejected. There are several other positions related to technology that go beyond the career of software engineer, and even in events like GHC you tend to become the minority of the minority, so it is up to us to position ourselves and be bold when we want something.
The inclusive leadership of Microsoft that was present by Gavriella ensured that I was interviewed, and what came after that is another story. I concluded my internship with a project ready to go into production, being guided by my current manager which is seriously “the best” (Thanks Dan!) and I being hired to be Microsoft's FTE in Vancouver.

Finally, I keep thinking about the main rejection lesson I took from this whole process. Rejection can make us bitter at times. That is why, once you have connected you with yourself, it is very important to know the value of those who connect with you, and to appreciate these people.

That teacher who dedicated himself during his rest period to write me a letter of recommendation, the Microsoft employee who won absolutely nothing by helping me fix my resume, Gavriella who is Microsoft's CVP and had no obligation to speak to a student unsure about her course in life. It is very important that you know how to understand why someone, or a company is rejecting you. But it is also important that you know how to see yourself as someone who deserves acceptance.
When you receive "YES", be grateful. Value and be loyal to these people and companies, because among several "no’s", they looked at you and said:

“I accept you! I include you! Let us build something amazing together!”

I said: YES!!!

When I abandoned the perspective of loss, when I left the “no’s” behind and embraced whoever was there, looking at me and my naked truth, I healed myself from this blindness that I had.

The blindness of thinking that I was:
“Unable to tell my own story” …

My name is Isadora, Microsoft Aspire and I hope I have inspired you today. Thank you!
